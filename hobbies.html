												<h3>Education/Learning New Things</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At 37 years old, I made the decision to return to college driven by a deep-seated desire for personal and professional growth. Recognizing the value of lifelong learning, I embarked on this journey with a fervent determination to seize every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills. The decision was not merely about obtaining a degree but about embracing a mindset of continuous learning. Inspired by the philosophy that "You should try to learn something new every day, otherwise the day has been wasted," I am committed to maximizing each day's potential by immersing myself in new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Embracing this mantra, I approach my academic pursuits with enthusiasm, seeking to extract insights from every lecture, discussion, and assignment. Moreover, beyond the confines of the classroom, I actively seek out opportunities for self-improvement, whether through reading, engaging with experts in my field, or pursuing extracurricular interests. By prioritizing lifelong learning, I aspire not only to advance my career prospects but also to cultivate a richer, more fulfilling life characterized by growth, curiosity, and self-discovery.</p>
